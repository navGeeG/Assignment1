## Project Overview

This repository contains Dart programs demonstrating core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts as required by the assignment questions. Each example is written in a simple and clear manner suitable for academic learning and practical understanding.

The concepts covered are:

1. Class and Object
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Constructors
5. Polymorphism

---

## 1. School Administration System (Class & Object)

### Description

This program demonstrates the relationship between a **Class** and an **Object** using a `Student` class. The class defines student attributes and behaviors, while objects represent actual students.

### Key Concepts

* Class definition
* Object instantiation
* Attributes and methods

### How to Run

```bash
dart run scenario1.dart
```

---

## 2. Online Bookstore (Abstraction)

### Description

This program uses **abstraction** to model different types of books. An abstract `Book` class defines common features, while `FictionBook` and `NonFictionBook` implement specific behaviors.

### Key Concepts

* Abstract class
* Abstract methods
* Method overriding

### How to Run

```bash
dart run scenario2.dart
```

---

## 3. Employee Management System (Inheritance)

### Description

This example demonstrates **inheritance** by creating an employee hierarchy. Common properties are defined in the `Employee` class and inherited by `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Intern` classes.

### Key Concepts

* Base class and subclasses
* Code reuse
* Specialized behaviors

### How to Run

```bash
dart run scenario3.dart
```

---

## 4. Vehicle Rental System (Constructors)

### Description

This program illustrates the use of **constructors** in Dart, including both default and named constructors, to initialize vehicle objects.

### Key Concepts

* Default constructor
* Named constructor
* Object initialization

### How to Run

```bash
dart run scenario4.dart
```

---

## 5. Geometry Library (Polymorphism)

### Description

This program demonstrates **polymorphism** by calculating areas of different shapes using a common `Shape` interface.

### Key Concepts

* Method overriding
* Runtime polymorphism
* Unified interface

### How to Run

```bash
dart run scenario5.dart
```

---

## General Instructions to Run the Programs

1. Install Dart SDK from: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
2. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   dart --version
   ```
3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd project-folder
   ```
5. Run any Dart file using:

   ```bash
   dart run filename.dart
   ```

---

## Conclusion

These programs collectively demonstrate the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Dart. The code is modular, readable, and designed for academic evaluation and future extension.
